# Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Summary of Client and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a security assessment of its web application. The company sought to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to ensure secure financial transactions and protect customer data. My task was to perform a vulnerability assessment and recommend improvements to strengthen the application’s security posture.

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities
During the assessment, I identified multiple security risks, including SQL injection, insecure data transmission, and improper input validation. By addressing these vulnerabilities, I helped ensure that Artemis Financial’s application aligns with secure coding best practices.

## Challenges and Key Learnings
One of the challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was conducting manual reviews to find potential security flaws in the application’s codebase. However, this process provided valuable insights into the importance of input validation, secure authentication, and proper error handling in web applications.

## Security Enhancements and Future Considerations
To improve the application’s security, I recommended:
- Implementing **stronger input validation** to prevent injection attacks.
- **Updating outdated libraries** to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Encrypting sensitive data** during storage and transmission.
- **Implementing role-based access controls** to restrict unauthorized access.

In the future, I would use tools like **OWASP Dependency-Check, Burp Suite, and static code analysis tools** to further assess vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation techniques.

## Ensuring Code Security and Integrity
After refactoring the application code, I tested the system using both **manual reviews and automated tools** to verify that no new security risks were introduced. I also performed regression testing to ensure that all functionalities remained intact.

## Useful Tools and Practices
Throughout this project, I utilized:
- **OWASP Dependency-Check** for identifying third-party vulnerabilities.
- **Secure coding practices** based on OWASP guidelines.
- **Static and dynamic code analysis** for thorough security testing.

## Value to Future Employers
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a **detailed vulnerability assessment, implement security best practices, and enhance software security**. Future employers can see my capability in securing web applications, mitigating risks, and improving overall software resilience.
